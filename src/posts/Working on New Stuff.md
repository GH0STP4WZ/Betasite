# New Website, Who Dis?
If you are here, you are probably wondering what happened to my website.
New domain? New Look and Feel? Everything feels...nice?!

Yea, I've been doing a little bit of Rebranding. I no longer go by "`Riddim_GLiTCH`", But instead, I go by "`R3DGH0STP4WZ`" (Pronounced "<span style="color: #f38ba8;">Red</span> Ghost Pawz") or just "`GH0STP4WZ`" (Pronounced "Ghost Pawz") now.
Friends may call me Ghostie. ðŸ–¤

But seriously though, what is new with all of this? Why all the sudden fuss?
Well. To put it short, I've been roughly inactive on the internet this year. Focussing most of my time on friend groups.
I only recently started properly working again, having joined the [`ðŸ”— Insane Kart Wii`](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Insane_Kart_wii) team, and setting out to make a track pack of my own, called "Nexus" (More TBA).

I'm also finally sitting down to properly learn C# this later, hopefully over the course of the rest and next year.

I've also been making steps in this whole Gender Transition thing. ***HRT SOON***???

But before anything, I wanna talk about some more personal matters that need talking about.

## The Personal Matters
### Whats new With Aurora?
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you; I'm not exactly the most...*filtered* person ever. I have gotten to a point where I actively call myself a faggot for how gay I am.
I often find myself calling really stupid things "retarded" as of late, and honestly, I'm not afraid to straight up call someone braindamaged if they spout really stupid takes on the internet.

I feel like I have degraded as a person. I guess its a good thing I see myself more as a Dog than a Person, then.

I mean, Just look at my Discord Profile:

<img src="https://github.com/GH0STP4WZ/beta.gh0stp4wz.github.io/blob/main/src/posts/media/Working%20on%20New%20Stuff/Discord_r62vIiJpom.png?raw=true">

I'm willing to publically declare my homosexuality like that. I think its safe to say my filter be gone.
And thats not even the worst of it...lol.


Furthermore, I have in fact learned that being gay as hell like this and being aromantic is not working out for me, I constantly feel a less sexual attraction to some of the girls ~~And a small handful of (fem)boys~~ I interact with on a regular basis.
I dont know what to call myself in that regard anymore, but I'm getting ready to put myself back on the Market, so to speak.

### Whats New in Tech?
My dear friend [`ðŸ”—EnK_`](https://enkdev.xyz) has helped me discover Jetbrains IDE's. Its what I used to rewrite this site with [`ðŸ”—11ty`](https://11ty.dev).
They are also responsible for me trying to get into C#, which is quite an undertaking, but I'm doing my best! :3

I've also joined the [`ðŸ”—Insane Kart Wii`](https://wiki.tockdon.com/wiki/Insane_Kart_Wii) team as a community administrator and Server Operator.
The Insane Kart Wii modpack currently runs on IKWFC, which is a reimplementation of the WFC online service, based on [`ðŸ”—WiiLinkWFC`](https://wfc.wiilink24.com/), that me, Toadette Hack Fan, and [`ðŸ”—Laura`](https://luxploit.net) have teamed up with to run.

Laura writes GO code for a living, and is of the opinion that WiiLinkWFC is poorly written. Regrettably, A poorly made joke about this made its way to the WWFC lead developer, who then promptly ragequit the project.
Pala, I dunno if you're reading this, but if you are, I'd like to stress again that we never meant it to be that negative, it was meant to be a comedic statement to start a conversation, which *would* have served as constructive critisism. We all chose our wording poorly, and we're all sorry for making you feel like shit.

I will not be sharing excerpts of this conversation because I'm pretty sure we're all trying to move on at this point, but I felt like it was something worth mentioning.

### Nexus Kart Wii?

Nexus Kart Wii.

Jokes aside though, I've been working on a small Mario Kart Wii Modpack of my own, Called Nexus (kart wii).
What it is? Well, its mostly just a collection of Good Mario Kart Wii tracks, mostly selected by the Community, stuffed in a pack with a good amount of Quality of Life additions, such as the ability to press pause in an online game to be able to leave at any time. Making it so that when your internet drops, you dont outright disconnect, and rather try to reconnect to the game,
Allowing the player to enable/disable a framerate cap of 30 (for those playing on lower specced machines running Dolphin). And many more.
It will also include a couple bug fixes for the game as well, as the vanilla game still has a bunch of bugs in it that can cause gameplay issues.


## Other Developments
I don't really have too much to say, but I've been thinking about some apps I might want to build...
heres a watered down version of the list:

 - A Mario Kart Wii Mod Manager with a built in My Stuff manager
 - Something like PrismLauncher, but for Servers. I already have a working Proof of Concept in Bash!
 - Some Minecraft Mod
 - An RSS feed for my blog? ðŸ‘€

These are things I will keep you lot posted about. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do any of these lol

Thats about it for this blogpost. I guess I will see you lot later. Who knows, Maybe this website releases with two new blog-posts.
