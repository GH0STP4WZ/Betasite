# New Website, Who Dis?
If you are here, you are probably wondering what happened to my website.
New domain? New Look and Feel? Everything feels...nice?!

Yea, I've been doing a little bit of Rebranding. I no longer go by "`Riddim_GLiTCH`", But instead, I go by "`R3DGH0STP4WZ`" (Pronounced "<span style="color: #f38ba8;">Red</span> Ghost Pawz") or just "`GH0STP4WZ`" (Pronounced "Ghost Pawz") now.
Friends may call me Ghostie. ðŸ–¤

But seriously though, what is new with all of this? Why all the sudden fuss?
Well. To put it short, I've been roughly inactive on the internet this year. Focussing most of my time on friend groups.
I only recently started properly working again, having joined the [`ðŸ”— Insane Kart Wii`](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Insane_Kart_wii) team, and setting out to make a track pack of my own, called "Nexus" (More TBA).

I'm also finally sitting down to properly learn C# this later, hopefully over the course of the rest and next year.

I've also been making steps in this whole Gender Transition thing. ***HRT SOON***???

But before anything, I wanna talk about some more personal matters that need talking about.

## The Personal Matters
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you; I'm not exactly the most...*filtered* person ever. I have gotten to a point where I actively call myself a faggot for how gay I am.
I often find myself calling really stupid things "retarded" as of late, and honestly, I'm not afraid to straight up call someone braindamaged if they spout really stupid takes on the internet.

I feel like I have degraded as a person. I guess its a good thing I see myself more as a Dog than a Person, then.

I mean, Just look at my Discord Profile:
