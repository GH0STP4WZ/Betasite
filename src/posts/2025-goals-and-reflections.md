# 2025 Goals and Reflections

As we step into 2025, I find myself reflecting on the journey of 2024 and looking ahead to what this new year might bring. It's been quite a ride!

## Looking Back at 2024

2024 was a year of significant growth and learning. Some highlights:

### Technical Achievements
- **Learned 11ty** - Finally made the switch from manual HTML to a proper static site generator
- **Improved my JavaScript skills** - Dove deeper into modern ES6+ features
- **Started contributing to open source** - Made my first meaningful contributions to several projects
- **Built my personal website** - You're looking at it right now!

### Personal Growth
- **Better work-life balance** - Learned to set boundaries and take breaks
- **Expanded my network** - Connected with amazing developers in the community
- **Improved communication** - Got better at explaining technical concepts
- **Stayed curious** - Never stopped learning and exploring new technologies

## Challenges I Overcame

Not everything was smooth sailing. Some obstacles I faced:

- **Imposter syndrome** - Still working on this, but I've made progress
- **Time management** - Balancing projects, learning, and personal life
- **Decision paralysis** - Too many cool technologies to choose from!

## Goals for 2025

Looking ahead, here's what I want to focus on:

### Technical Goals
1. **Master React** - Build at least 3 substantial projects
2. **Learn a backend framework** - Probably Node.js with Express
3. **Contribute more to open source** - Aim for 50+ contributions
4. **Write more blog posts** - Target: 2 posts per month
5. **Build a SaaS product** - Turn an idea into reality

### Personal Goals
1. **Maintain consistency** - Regular coding practice and learning
2. **Build in public** - Share my journey and learnings
3. **Mentor others** - Help newcomers in the dev community
4. **Attend conferences** - Network and learn from others
5. **Take care of health** - Regular exercise and proper sleep

## Strategies for Success

To make these goals reality, I'm implementing:

- **Time blocking** - Dedicated slots for different activities
- **Public accountability** - Sharing progress on social media
- **Regular reviews** - Monthly check-ins on goal progress
- **Flexibility** - Adjusting goals as I learn and grow

## Final Thoughts

2025 feels full of potential. The tech industry continues to evolve rapidly, and there are so many exciting opportunities ahead. Whether it's AI, web3, or something completely new, I'm excited to be part of this journey.

Here's to a year of growth, learning, and building amazing things! ðŸš€
